            <p style="font-size: 27px;">We envision a world in which all children can pursue a quality education that
                enables them to reach their full potential and contribute to their communities and the world.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Room to Read seeks to transform the lives of millions of children in low-income communities by focusing
                on literacy and gender equality in education. Working in collaboration with local communities, partner
                organizations and governments, we develop literacy skills and a habit of reading among primary school
                children, and support girls to complete secondary school with the relevant life skills to succeed in
                school and beyond. </p>
